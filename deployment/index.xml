We will attempt to get you up and running with CRS as quick as possible. This guide assumes ModSecurity is already working. If you are unsure see the extended install page. Otherwise, lets jump in.
You&amp;rsquo;ll first need to download the ruleset. Using a browser (or equivalent) visit the following URL:
wget https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/archive/master.zip Once this is installed extract it somewhere well known on your server.</description></item><item><title>Installing CoreRuleSet</title><link>https://fzipi.github.io/coreruleset-documentation/deployment/install/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fzipi.github.io/coreruleset-documentation/deployment/install/</guid><description>If you need mode information than the one in the quickstart guide, here we extend with additional details so keep reading.
